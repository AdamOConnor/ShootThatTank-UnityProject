# ShootThatTank-UnityProject

This project was developed due to an assignment that had to be completed, 

within the project there must be a 3d element within the game that has level's going from easy to hard, 
the objective of the game is to collect intel from the enemys, that are trying to shoot your tank down. When all intel is gathered.The user's tank must then get to the safe zone with all the piece's of intel.

Enemy tanks have AI attached that follow a certain route and are then attracted to the player's tank and follow's them until it gets out of range of the target.
